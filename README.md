# Chemical_stucture_prediction_using_GNNs
- preprocessing data
- parameter search
- pipelining
- **models used**: graph neural networks (GNN)
- **dataset**: uses speed dating dataset available on Kaggl or PubChem
- **goal**: Th structure of chemical compounds can offer insight into not only the nature of the molecule, but also its properties and relationships internally and within molecules. Studying such compounds could benefit from the application of graph neural networks (GNN). This is a powerful tool for modeling and capturing dependencies and relationships between compounds. “conventional” data more resembles a feature-value vector format, whereas graphs exhibit a node-edge format with no vector representation. This creates a challenge for which GNNs were developed where given a set of training graphs associated with a label, the network will learn a model from these training graphs and tries to predict the unseen graph.
